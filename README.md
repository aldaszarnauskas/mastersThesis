# mastersThesis

In this repository, I keep scripts used in my master's thesis to get an M.Sc. in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology degree.
Scripts comprise bash and R scripts. The bash script was used to inspect the quality of raw RNA-seq gene expression data followed by read alignment and count table generation. R scripts were used to perform various analyses including differential gene expression, gene set enrichment analysis, single sample gene set enrichment analysis and transcription factor enrichment analysis.
I have also uploaded my master's thesis.
